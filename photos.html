      <p class="intro">This is a web page devoted to showing pictures of New York and other places that catch my attention as I learn to develop an eye for corners, spaces, people, and environments that seem to go away as soon as I pass them by with me body, my thoughts, and my intentions. Many of these places hold moments that are fleeting, but that live within a specific light, a specific mood, and a specific sensation. I invite you to explore these images so you can better appreciate the art of looking and  living </p>
